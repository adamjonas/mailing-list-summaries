They propose two new opcodes: `OP_TRIGGER_FORWARD` and `OP_FORWARD_DESTINATION`, along with a replacement for the two opcodes.The second context is about a proposed opcode for modifying a TLUV-ish script called `idx . npush script OP_FORWARD_LEAF_UPDATE (OP_FLU :)`. The proposed opcode involves popping various elements off the stack, prefixing a script with a minimal push of an entry, calculating an spk, and checking if the output at idx matches the spk. There is also a focus on making the opcode more flexible and allowing it to accumulate value from one or more inputs into specified outputs.The third context revolves around a proposed idea for a vault construct that involves using the EXPR_TRIGGER to include a trigger, authentication, spend-delay, OP_CSV, OP_DROP and OP_FORWARD_OUTPUTS, along with the inclusion of idx and hash in the witness stack at spend time. The discussion also touches upon withdrawal authorization, setting CSV timeout to 0, batching, accounting, and refund paths.In the fourth context, the writer is new to bitcoin-dev but has read a draft that has some functionality they're interested in. They want to restrict multiple tapleaves on the amount they can spend and have specific requirements for each participant's output. They outline a scenario where Bob spends their output and explain the restrictions on their next transaction. They also propose a solution for two of the three participants separately broadcasting transactions, suggesting that the second sender can combine the transactions into a package with adjusted outputs and witnesses. The writer mentions BIP's like OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY and OP_AMOUNTVERIFY and acknowledges they're not aware of previous risks discussed by the community.</p><br><b>References:</b><ul><li>Greg Sanders: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021510.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP for OP_VAULT</a></li></ul><ul><li>Anthony Towns: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021514.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP for OP_VAULT</a></li></ul><ul><li>Greg Sanders: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021516.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP for OP_VAULT</a></li></ul><ul><li>Andrew Melnychuk Oseen: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021518.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP for OP_VAULT</a></li></ul><br><hr style='border-top: dotted 2px; '><h2 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana;'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Fee-redistribution contracts</h2><b>Date: </b><i>2023-02-27 13:32:01</i><p>Number of replies: 4</p><h3 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana; color:#282828;'>"Proposal for Smarter Fee Redistribution in Bitcoin Mining"</h3><p>The context revolves around proposed solutions for long-term miner incentives in Bitcoin mining. One approach is to intervene with solutions like tail-emissions, demurrage, and fee-redistribution schemes, such as the one proposed in the paper. The proposed solution suggests redistributing transaction fees back to miners through contracts that collect and redistribute a fraction of the fees back to the miner in a smarter way. However, the proposal has flaws, including the possibility of miners excluding certain blocks to the detriment of their counter parties and the difficulty of convincing the ecosystem to change from competitive to cooperative mining. Another suggested approach is "Future Saving" through transaction fees, where a portion of the fees is saved until a threshold is reached and added to the low block reward. Additionally, an email exchange between Rastislav Budinsky and Dave discusses the possibility of incentivizing miners to prefer out-of-band fees, which could prevent effective fee redistribution as proposed by Rastislav. Finally, there is a need to develop appropriate incentives and costs to address the issue of long-term miner incentives in Bitcoin mining.</p><br><b>References:</b><ul><li>Rastislav Budinsky: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021505.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Fee-redistribution contracts</a></li></ul><ul><li>HcaFc_jbe: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021506.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Fee-redistribution contracts</a></li></ul><ul><li>shymaa arafat: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021507.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Fee-redistribution contracts</a></li></ul><ul><li>David A.

In a scenario where block rewards are almost zero, transaction fees end up being very small because there is enough space for everyone in a block. This can lead to rational behavior for miners to fork the chain tip, resulting in increased reorgs/orphan rates and chain instability. The author suggests that introducing min_fees could bring the equilibrium closer to a socially optimal one and benefit network security in the long term. However, the author acknowledges that this is just a rough sketch and would require a deeper analysis. Bitcoin's network security is compromised as there is no equilibrium between active users and miners. A system where all users participate in ensuring its long-term security is honest, while a system where only active users participate and passive stakeholders are de facto long-term dishonest free riders is not honest. Introducing min_fees could help create an equilibrium and benefit network security in the long term.</p><br><b>References:</b><ul><li>Giuseppe B: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021512.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Minimum fees</a></li></ul><ul><li>Nadav Ivgi: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021513.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Minimum fees</a></li></ul><ul><li>jk_14 at op.pl: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021520.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Minimum fees</a></li></ul><br><hr style='border-top: dotted 2px; '><h2 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana;'>[bitcoin-dev] Refreshed BIP324</h2><b>Date: </b><i>2023-02-28 18:07:06</i><p>Number of replies: 2</p><h3 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana; color:#282828;'>"Proposed Changes to Short Message Type IDs in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals Repository on GitHub"</h3><p>The bitcoin improvement proposals repository on GitHub has a pull request available following a discussion about short 1-byte message type IDs.

The suggestion is to use 1 byte according to protocol but reserve the top bit to indicate a two-byte ID with 128 choices when space runs out, set the top bit again to indicate another two-byte ID, similar to how integers are stored in protobuf.</p><br><b>References:</b><ul><li>Dhruv M: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021508.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Refreshed BIP324</a></li></ul><ul><li>Erik Aronesty: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021509.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Refreshed BIP324</a></li></ul><br><hr style='border-top: dotted 2px; '><h2 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana;'>[bitcoin-dev] Using service bit 24 for utreexo signaling in testnet and signet</h2><b>Date: </b><i>2023-03-02 06:55:19</i><p>Number of replies: 3</p><h3 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana; color:#282828;'>"Bitcoin Development Discussion: Utilizing Service Bit 24 for Utreexo-Capable Nodes on Testnet and Signet"</h3><p>The context includes discussion amongst members of a Bitcoin development mailing list regarding the use of service bits to indicate Utreexo capable nodes on testnet and signet.

He also asked if anyone else was using the same bit for another purpose. In a separate discussion, kcalvinalvin suggested documenting a concept as a BIP and utilizing a service bit assignment, which Luke agreed with. The context notes that experimental service bits are used for experiments and that bit 24 is currently unused while bit 26 is being used by full-rbf.</p><br><b>References:</b><ul><li>kcalvinalvin: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021515.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Using service bit 24 for utreexo signaling in testnet and signet</a></li></ul><ul><li>Luke Dashjr: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021517.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Using service bit 24 for utreexo signaling in testnet and signet</a></li></ul><ul><li>Peter Todd: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-March/021519.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Using service bit 24 for utreexo signaling in testnet and signet</a></li></ul><br></body></html>
