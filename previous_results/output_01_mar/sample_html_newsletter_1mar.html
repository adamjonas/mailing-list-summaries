This solution involves a mechanism to save a portion of transaction fees and redistribute it back to the miner in a 'smarter' way; i.e. multiple contracts can be used, each averaging the collected fees over different time frames, making mining more secure and predictable against drastic fluctuations in fees. It is proposed that this solution could be implemented as a soft-fork, with scripts in Bitcoin being stateless, and generally spendable script by anyone holding the funds created. However, there are flaws with this proposal, such as miners being more aggressive in excluding certain blocks, there being no reference to op-codes or implementations, and changing the mining incentive structure from competitive to cooperative may affect mining centralization.</p><br><b>References:</b><ul><li>Rastislav Budinsky: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021505.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Fee-redistribution contracts</a></li></ul><ul><li>HcaFc_jbe: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021506.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Fee-redistribution contracts</a></li></ul><ul><li>shymaa arafat: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021507.html'>[bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Fee-redistribution contracts</a></li></ul><br><hr style='border-top: dotted 2px; '><h2 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana;'>[bitcoin-dev] Codex32</h2><b>Date: </b><i>2023-02-22 16:29:03</i><p>Number of replies: 6</p><h3 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana; color:#282828;'>"Verifying Accuracy of Codex32 Strings: The Advantages of 2 Character Quick Checks"</h3><p>A simpler approach to error correction in Codex32 can be taken with minimal trust by using a mod N = 0 checksum, either by creating the seed such that each share passes, or by storing an additional word/symbol with the seed. This checksum can be computed manually or with a computer and a lookup table, and if all shares have the same checksum, it may be sufficient for everyone to write down the checksums of the other shares, to verify they are correct. Furthermore, generators for degree 2 BCH codes can be divided into quadratic and linear components which allows for "quickcheck" verification of strings of any size from 1 character to 13 characters. A 1 character quickchecksum will guarantee detection of any single error, while a 3 character quickchecksum will detect up to two character errors. It is recommended to perform quick checks with a minimum size of 2, as it has a 0.1% failure rate. To increase security, Peter Todd's suggestion of using a lookup table on "words" (pairs of Bech32 characters) and adding values together was taken into account, though the addition requires Bech32 rather than calculator addition. Performing 2 character quick checks is an effective way to verify accuracy, as there are 7 different ways of building the table used in this process, and employing each one of them is equivalent to performing a full checksum verification. This has advantages such as catching any new 1 character error introduced since the last visit, and 99.9% chance of catching any other random errors introduced since the last visit.</p><br><b>References:</b><ul><li>Peter Todd: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021498.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Codex32</a></li></ul><ul><li>Russell O'Connor: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021500.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Codex32</a></li></ul><ul><li>Russell O'Connor: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021501.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Codex32</a></li></ul><ul><li>Russell O'Connor: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021502.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Codex32</a></li></ul><ul><li>Russell O'Connor: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021503.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Codex32</a></li></ul><ul><li>Russell O'Connor: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021504.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Codex32</a></li></ul><br><hr style='border-top: dotted 2px; '><h2 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana;'>[bitcoin-dev] Refreshed BIP324</h2><b>Date: </b><i>2023-02-28 18:07:06</i><p>Number of replies: 2</p><h3 style='text-align:center; font-family:verdana; color:#282828;'>Exploring Efficient Identification of Bitcoin Network Messages with 1-Byte Message Type IDs</h3><p>On 2/21/23, Anthony Towns proposed changes to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) repository in a pull request, introducing short 1-byte message type IDs. This would allow messages sent over the Bitcoin network to be identified and routed more efficiently, as they would only require one byte instead of several bytes, thus improving scalability and reducing latency. When designing a protocol, it is recommended to reserve the top bit for use when more space is needed. This technique, seen in Protocol Buffers (protobuf), stores integers with the top bit set to signal that a two-byte identification is being used instead of the one-byte version, allowing the protocol to expand as needed while still providing efficient storage.</p><br><b>References:</b><ul><li>Dhruv M: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021508.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Refreshed BIP324</a></li></ul><ul><li>Erik Aronesty: <a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-February/021509.html'>[bitcoin-dev] Refreshed BIP324</a></li></ul><br></body></html>
