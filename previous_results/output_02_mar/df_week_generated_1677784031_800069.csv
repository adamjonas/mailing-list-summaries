The author suggests decoupling the three functionalities of OP_VAULT and OP_UNVAULT into their constituent functions with names he created. He notes four goals for this redesign: 1) removing variable arguments based on values of arguments, 2) removing recursive evaluation functionality used for authentication, 3) increasing legibility of the spec, and 4) not greatly increasing the expressiveness of the proposal. The covenant opcodes are intended to be drop-in replacements for the OP_(UN)VAULT opcodes. The author provides a sketch of a replacement for the two opcodes, which involves two new opcodes: OP_TRIGGER_FORWARD and OP_FORWARD_DESTINATION. Typical usage scenarios are provided, including depositing to vault script and triggering withdrawal timer script.', 'The context discusses a proposed generalization for a script opcode that could be used to modify a TLUV-ish script in a safe and more generic way. The proposed opcode, called OP_FORWARD_LEAF_UPDATE, would allow the user to prefix a script with push opcodes, avoiding the possibility of adding OP_SUCCESS instructions, which could be unsafe. The proposed opcode would also enable accumulative behavior for multiple inputs into specified outputs. Additionally, the context suggests an additional opcode, OP_FORWARD_REFUND, to cover the accumulation of value from one or more inputs into specified outputs, allowing for refunds without doubling the delay. Overall, the proposed opcodes would make TLUV payment pools possible with minimal effort.', 'The context is a technical discussion between two individuals, AJ and Greg, about a proposal for implementing withdrawal authorization in a vault construct. They discuss the details of the proposal, including changes to the syntax and functionality of EXPR_TRIGGER, the addition of withdrawal authorization as part of the script, and the potential for batching transactions. They also consider the implications of setting CSV timeout to 0, and the need to commit to a refund path up front.

Under the current system, miners take all fees when they mine a block, but the proposed solution would have them take only a fraction, with the remaining amount sent to one or more contracts that redistribute it back to the miner in a smarter way. The proposal does not introduce any new Bitcoins, only redistributes collected fees. Multiple contracts could be used, each averaging collected fees over different time frames. The benefits of the proposal are discussed in the forthcoming paper and should make mining more secure and predictable against drastic fee fluctuations. The author believes most miners should not oppose this solution as it should create a better mining environment. The proposal is not yet finalized and the author welcomes opinions and discussions on its feasibility and parameters. The author acknowledges their lack of developer experience but suggests a generally spendable script might be created for miners to follow, embedded into consensus nodes themselves, thus avoiding a disruptive hard-fork."", 'The context discusses the issue of long-term miner incentives and proposes a fee-redistribution scheme to address potential problems when block subsidies run out in the future. The intervention options include tail-emissions, demurrage, and fee-redistribution schemes, but it is still too early to determine if mining incentives will be a problem and what the solutions should be. The fee-redistribution scheme aims to solve undercutting attacks and fee-variance between blocks. However, the proposal has flaws, including the possibility of miners excluding certain blocks without losing fees, the difficulty of constructing the smart-contract, convincing the ecosystem to change the competitive mining structure to cooperative, achieving miner consensus in implementing the scheme, and the incorrect description of block creation distribution as exponential instead of Poisson.', 'The author suggests that the Bitcoin community should consider a ""Future Saving"" strategy through transaction fees to address the block reward problem. The idea involves saving a portion of transaction fees, halving it with each reward halving until a threshold is reached where the saved amounts are added to the low block reward. The author notes that the block reward problem will not start only in 2140 but when mining costs become comparable to reward value, which may occur as early as 2040. The author acknowledges that a game-theoretic model must be built with appropriate incentives and costs to determine exact numbers.', 'In a bitcoin developer\'s email thread, Rastislav Budinsky questioned the assumption that miners could only profit by collecting transaction fees. He pointed out that miners can accept payment through alternative means known as ""out-of-band fees."" These are not frequently used because correctly estimated in-band fees have an advantage and good fee estimation is easily accessible to modern wallets. However, if consensus rules are changed to require each miner pay a percentage of its in-band fees to future miners, then there would be a strong incentive for them to prefer out-of-band fees, which could undermine Bitcoin\'s decentralization. Dave added that a serious consideration of Budinsky\'s proposal can only proceed if it adequately addresses the problem of out-of-band fees.']",Proposing a Fee-Redistribution Scheme for Long-Term Miner Incentives in Bitcoin Mining,"The context revolves around the issue of long-term miner incentives and proposes a fee-redistribution scheme to address potential problems when block subsidies run out in the future.

In this scenario, miners may fork the chain tip and compete for fees in the latest block, causing an increase in reorgs/orphan rates and chain instability. Miners may also set their low_fee to zero to prevent other miners from forking their blocks off.
